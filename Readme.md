Boilerplate for Flask EB applications
=====================================

The boilerplate defines the basic structure of flask applications that will
live on Elastic Beanstalk. This boilerplate, in addition to the classic
python stack, includes support for NewRelic, Sentry, and Loggly.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The installation is very straightforward, but make sure you are using at least
python 3.4. If you use a Mac, you can install it using `brew`. If you use
Windows, just ask for a remote VM that has it installed for you.

```bash
$ cd flask-eb
$ pyvenv env
(env) $ . env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(env) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Permissions

In PROD and QA environments, to accept and authorize incoming and outgoing
requests, make sure you have the right DynamoDB permissions, as highlighted
in the corresponding [tech design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eHoI_BddTFMi15yCaHS6KvhSSoTrMEd3WwJINIpgNpM/edit).

### Running

When all dependencies have been installed, you can run the flask application
on your local instance by running:

```bash
(env) $ python dev.py
```

or

```bash
make dev
```

By using the development server, you will have access to specific features that
are not necessarily available in production, such as the exception tracer.

### Testing

To run the tests, all you have to do is to run:

```bash
(env) $ py.test tests/ --cov my_project --cov-report term-missing
(env) $ flake8 my_project/ tests/
```

or

To run tests: `make test`

To lint: `make lint`

### Updating

To install new dependencies.

```bash
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(env) $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

or

```bash
make pip_dev
```

### Notes

Windows users will not be able to use the `make` commands as Make is a Unix util.
Windows users can attempt to install [GNUWin](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) to get this functionality.

### Customizing the boilerplate

The goal of a boilerplate is to help you get started quickly while setting you
for success.

1. Rename `my_project` directory with the name of your application.
2. Find all occurrences of `my_project` in your application and rename them with
   the name of your application.
3. Make sure you can launch your dev application and run the tests before
   sending the pull request for review.

## Features of the Boilerplate

### Linting

This boilerplate comes with customization on flake8 plugins. Please make sure you keep any derivative flask microservices in-sync with these standards, as they are added.

### Third-Party Integrations for Reporting

This boilerplate comes with support for Loggly, Sentry, and NewRelic.

### Grass Access Validation

The boilerplate includes module `validation.access` which contains functionality for validating Grass headers in the context of a Flask request. This is valuable for making microservice endpoints compatible for both Grass and non-Grass (i.e. microservice-to-microservice) requests. It makes it easier to facilitate endpoint reuse.

For example, suppose you need to validate that a request where Grass headers are required. Additionally, the `vendor_id` passed in the route must match - thus the Grass Account Type must be 'vendor' and the Grass Account Id must match `vendor_id`. You would use as follows:

```python
@app.route('/vendor/<vendor_id>/something')
def do_something_only_for_vendors(vendor_id):
    """Do something only for vendors.

    Args:
        vendor_id (int): unique identifier for vendor.
    """

    validation = access.verify_grass_access(
        request, required=True, vendor=vendor_id)
    if not validation:
        return validation

    // do something
```

Another example - suppose Grass headers are not required. Additionally, the `subaccount_id` passed in the route must match. The only acceptable Account Type is subaccount:

```python
@app.route('/subaccount/<subaccount_id>/something')
def do_something_only_for_subaccounts(subaccount_id):
    """Do something only for subaccounts.

    Args:
        subaccount_id (int): unique identifier for subaccount.
    """

    account_type, account_id = access.get_grass_headers(request)
    validation = access.verify_grass_access(
        request, required=False, subaccount=subaccount_id)
    if not validation:
        return validation

    // do something
```

Now, building on the last example, we can accept Account Type of vendor AND subaccount:

```python
@app.route('/subaccount/<subaccount_id>/something')
def do_something(subaccount_id):
    """Do something.

    Args:
        subaccount_id (int): unique identifier for subaccount.
    """

    account_type, account_id = access.get_grass_headers(request)
    validation = access.verify_grass_access(
        request, required=False, vendor=account_id, subaccount=subaccount_id)
    if not validation:
        return validation

    // do something
```
